# YelpAnalytics - an economic data visualization tool  

## Background and Overview

A simple glance at the average Yelp rating of a restaurant or business provides a helpful, but limited understanding of its quality of service. The restaurant industry is especially notorious for its unpredictability, with even well-rated establishments being nonetheless vulnerable to the vicissitudes of market and social trends.

YelpAnalytics provides a more in depth representation of a business' popularity and average rating over time, thereby enabling users to make more accurate projections of a business' growth trajectory.

## Functionality & MVP

In YelpAnalytics, users will be able to:

- [ ] Search for a business by location and category, identical to the Yelp search function
- [ ] Select data visualization for the given business' number of ratings per month or year
- [ ] Select data visualization for the given business' average rating over time 
- [ ] Vary the time period over which the data visualization is displayed, by date and duration (e.g. August 2013 - February 2015)
